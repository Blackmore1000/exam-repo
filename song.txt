Kneel down you sinners to streetwise religion
Greed's been crowned the new king
Hollywood dream teens, yesterday's trash queens
Save the blessings for the final ring, amen

(Chorus)
Take a ride on the wild side
Wild side

[Verse 2]
I carry my crucifix under my death list
Forward my mail to me in hell
Liars and the martyrs lost faith in the Father
Long lost is the wishing well
